# CDA Settings Backend Reference

## Purpose

Reference for backend, API, and LLM consumers that need to understand the CDA Settings surface.

This covers:
- Commission plans
- Fee types
- Default assignments
- All CTAs, menus, inputs, toggles, and dialogs
- Role access and permission boundaries
- Validation and downstream calculation impact

## Source Basis

This doc is derived from:
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/pages/CDASettings.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/components/finance/fee-builder-modal.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/pages/AssignDefaults.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/pages/CommissionPlanBuilder.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/pages/FeeTypeBuilder.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/app/pages/CDAInsertionMap.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/imports/pasted_text/cda-settings-page.tsx`
- `workspace/web-app/src/imports/pasted_text/cda-design-system.md`

## Product Context

CDA means Closing Disclosure Audit.

CDA Settings powers automatic CDA calculations in Deal Terms and downstream review flows.

Core dependency chain:
1. CDA Settings defines default commission plans and fee types.
2. Default assignments attach plans and fees to agents.
3. Deal Terms and CDA breakdown screens consume those defaults.
4. Team Lead can override in review.
5. Auditor finalizes Radius fee and company dollar.

## Route / Surface Map

| Surface | Purpose | Primary Users |
|---|---|---|
| CDA Settings | Manage commission plans, fee types, and default assignments | Team Lead, Admin |
| Commission Plan Builder | Create or edit a plan | Team Lead, Admin |
| Fee Type Builder | Create or edit a fee type | Team Lead, Admin |
| Assign Defaults | Map plans and fees to agents | Team Lead, Admin |
| CDA Breakdown | Calculate and review CDA | Agent, Team Lead |
| Team Lead Review | Adjust CDA before agent confirmation | Team Lead |
| Auditor Verification | Final manual verification | Auditor |

## Role Permissions

### Permission Matrix

| Role | Can View CDA Settings | Can Create / Edit Plans | Can Create / Edit Fees | Can Assign Defaults | Can Archive | Can Apply Changes to Under-Contract Deals | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Team Lead | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Primary operator for settings |
| Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Same settings access as TL in current surface |
| Agent | No | No | No | No | No | No | Consumes defaults in CDA flows only |
| Team Member | No | No | No | No | No | No | No settings access defined |
| TC | No | No | No | No | No | No | Works in transaction scope only |
| Auditor | No | No | No | No | No | No | Uses final verification flow, not settings |

### Role Notes

- Team Lead and Admin are the only roles allowed to access CDA Settings. This is explicitly called out in the insertion map.
- Agents can see the effects of settings in CDA breakdown and confirmation flows, but not the settings page.
- TC and Auditor consume the result of settings, not the settings themselves.
- If backend enforces authorization, CDA Settings should be a hard permission boundary.

## Assignment Side Effects

| Change | Result |
|---|---|
| Add or edit assignment | Agent’s default CDA rules update |
| Apply to under contract deals enabled | Active CDA forecasts recalculate |
| Clear assignment | Agent reverts to no default plan / fee mapping |
| Change plan with overwrite confirmed | Existing defaults are replaced |

## Fee and Plan Semantics

### Commission Plans

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Standard | Fixed agent/team split |
| Tiered | Split changes by range and reset period |

### Fee Types

| Attribute | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Pre-split | Deduct before split basis is allocated |
| Post-split | Deduct after agent allocation |
| Agent | Applies to agent share |
| Team | Applies to team share |
| Both | Applies to both shares |
| Cap contribution | Included in cap background math, not always displayed directly |

## Downstream Consumers

| Screen / Flow | Reads From CDA Settings |
|---|---|
| Deal Terms | Default commission plan and fee defaults |
| CDA Breakdown | Split and deduction structure |
| Team Lead Review | Editable defaults and plan overrides |
| Agent Confirmation | Final agent payout values |
| Auditor Verification | Radius fee and company dollar verification |
| Affected Deals preview | Under-contract recalc impact |

## Backend Contract Notes

### Recommended API Concepts

| Resource | Suggested Operations |
|---|---|
| commission_plans | list, create, update, archive, duplicate |
| fee_types | list, create, update, archive, duplicate |
| default_assignments | list, upsert, clear, bulk_upsert |
| affected_deals_preview | read-only preview for under-contract recalc |

### Important Behavior

- Archived plans and fees should remain historically traceable.
- Duplicate should create a new record, not mutate the original.
- Default assignment changes may affect active CDA forecasts.
- Changing settings after agent confirmation should be treated carefully because downstream flows may need reset logic.
- Unknown or unsupported access should be treated as `no access` until product explicitly defines otherwise.

## Summary

The CDA Settings surface is the source of truth for:
- Split rules
- Deduction rules
- Agent defaults
- Active CDA recalculation behavior

Backend should treat it as a permissioned configuration system, not just a list page.
